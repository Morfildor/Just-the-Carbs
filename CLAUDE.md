# CarbScan — session context

Read this first. It records what previous sessions verified so you don't re-derive it.

## Build an APK right now

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME="C:\atools\jdk-21.0.12+8"
$env:ANDROID_HOME="C:\atools\sdk"
cd C:\Users\tuncb\Desktop\CarbTracker
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug
```

Output: `app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk` (~88 MB).
A copy is kept on the Desktop as **`CarbScan-debug.apk`** — install that on a phone.

Other useful tasks:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat :app:testDebugUnitTest         # 167 JVM tests
.\gradlew.bat :app:lintDebug                 # lint (clean)
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleRelease           # minified, UNSIGNED (~64 MB)

## What this project is

Native Android app: scan a food barcode → enter portion → read carbohydrate grams. As of
2026-08-14, the portion step can also be a **count** ("2 slices") when a trustworthy per-item
weight exists — see [Countable portions](#countable-portions-2026-08-14) below.
Requirements are in **`docs/MASTER-PROMPT.md`** (referenced throughout as §N).
Design decisions are in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-13-carbquick-design.md` (original) and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-countable-portions-design.md` (countable portions).

**It does NOT calculate insulin.** Not a diet tracker. Scope discipline is a hard requirement (§2).

**Working name is CarbScan** (`app.carbscan`). Docs under `docs/` still say *CarbQuick* — the owner
has NOT decided the public name, so do not sweep the docs. Branding is genuinely centralised in
`branding.gradle.kts` (Gradle `extra` properties feeding namespace, applicationId, versionName,
`app_name` and the OFF User-Agent).

GitHub: **https://github.com/Morfildor/CarbScan** — private, and staying private for now.

## Status (2026-08-14)

- ✅ Domain calculation engine, TDD — `CarbCalculator`, `NutritionBasis`, `PortionParser`,
  `NutritionValueValidator`, `PackageQuantityParser`, `BarcodeValidator`, `ResultFormatter`
- ✅ Room + `ProductRepository` owning the §10 lookup priority
- ✅ Open Food Facts data source behind the `ProductDataSource` abstraction
- ✅ Full UI: home, scanner, calculator, manual entry, verify dialog, label OCR, settings
- ✅ Debug APK and minified release APK both build; release smoke-tested (launches, no crash) on
  the emulator with a debug-signed copy — the committed release artifact stays unsigned
- ✅ §73 documentation set complete in `docs/`, incl. new `security-review.md` and
  `ux-critique-countable-portions.md`
- ✅ CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- ✅ §60 Compose UI tests (16 behaviour tests on the calculator)
- ✅ Manual barcode entry (§8); live Open Food Facts verified end to end incl. product images
- ✅ **Countable portions** (2026-08-14) — see dedicated section below
- ✅ **167 JVM unit tests, lint clean**
- ✅ **41/42 instrumented tests passing**; 1 has documented order-dependent flakiness in the full
  suite (passes reliably in isolation) — see "Countable portions" below, not a functional bug
- ❌ Not done: release signing, AAB, systematic multi-device testing

## Countable portions (2026-08-14)

Major feature: portion entry can be a count ("2 slices") instead of a weight, when a trustworthy
per-item weight exists. Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-14-countable-portions-design.md`.
UX critique: `docs/ux-critique-countable-portions.md`. Security: `docs/security-review.md`.

**Architecture** — one formula, unchanged: `PortionResolver` (pure, `count × amountPerUnit`) is a
conversion layer in front of `CarbCalculator`, never a second calculation path.
`ServingSizeParser` cautiously turns OFF's free-text `serving_size` into a `PortionUnitCandidate`
(English + Dutch input recognition — the app's own UI strings stay English-only, an owner
correction mid-session). `PortionUnit` mirrors `Product`'s provenance/verification split exactly.

**Room v3**: new `portion_units` table (FK cascade to `products`, verified against a normally-opened
`CarbScanDatabase`, not just the migration-test harness — see below) plus
`lastInputMode`/`lastSelectedPortionUnitId`/`lastCount` on `products`. `MIGRATION_2_3` guards every
`ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` with a `PRAGMA table_info` check — not defensive theatre: Room's own
`MigrationTestHelper` was observed re-invoking the migration during its validation pass, which made
a naive (non-idempotent) `ALTER` fail with "duplicate column" as a pure testing artefact.

**OFF migrated v2 → v3** (checked 2026-08-14: v3 current, v2 deprecated-but-supported, fields this
app reads unchanged between the two). `serving_quantity` is deliberately NOT used to derive a
countable unit — OFF documents it as its own normalized extraction from `serving_size`, not an
independently trustworthy per-unit weight.

**Networking hardened**: `ProductImageUrlValidator` (HTTPS + OFF-image-host allowlist) gates every
remote image URL — previously unvalidated. Retrofit and Coil now share **one** `OkHttpClient`
instance (`AppContainer.okHttpClient`) — previously two separately-constructed clients with
matching config, not a real shared instance.

**Two genuine findings from actually running the tests, not just reading the code:**
1. Room's `MigrationTestHelper` connection does not enforce the `portion_units` FK's
   `ON DELETE CASCADE` the same way a normally-opened `CarbScanDatabase` does — confirmed by adding
   `PortionUnitDaoTest.deletingAProductCascadesToItsPortionUnits`, which uses
   `Room.inMemoryDatabaseBuilder` (the real production path) and passes. Trust the production-path
   test over the migration-harness one for this specific question.
2. `CountablePortionScreenTest.addingAPortionUnitThroughTheInlineFormMakesItImmediatelyUsable` is
   flaky specifically when run as part of the full 42-test suite (passes reliably alone, and the
   same behaviour is covered reliably by 5 other tests). A `waitUntil` poll timing out rather than
   eventually succeeding rules out simple recomposition-timing; likely emulator IME/focus state
   carrying over between test-activity transitions. Documented in the test, not silently retried.

### Verified by actually running it (API 36 emulator)

- §70 new product: 48.2 g/100 g × 65 g → **31 g** / *31.3 g calculated*
- §70 known product: tap recent → portion pre-filled → instant result
- ml basis: 9.4 g/100 ml × 250 ml → **24 g**, portion locked to ml
- Dutch comma decimal, dark mode, 1.8× font scale
- Minified release build runs; Room, enums and ML Kit all survive R8

### Verified by the owner on a physical device (2026-08-14)

- **Barcode scanning works.**
- **Nutrition-label OCR works.**

These were the two largest unknowns and are now closed. Do not re-list them as unverified.

### NOT verified — do not claim otherwise

- Live Open Food Facts responses end to end (tested against MockWebServer, not the real API).
- Behaviour across a range of physical devices, incl. Samsung Galaxy specifics (§61 §14).
- The release (R8) build on physical hardware — it runs on the emulator.
- **Countable portions against a real OFF `serving_size` response.** All automated coverage uses
  fixtures; no live product with a countable-unit-shaped `serving_size` has been scanned and
  checked against real packaging. See `docs/manual-qa.md` §15a, currently unchecked.
- Countable portions on a physical device at all — built and instrumented-tested on the emulator
  only, same caveat as the rest of this build.

## Toolchain (installed — do NOT reinstall)

| Thing | Path |
|---|---|
| JDK 21.0.12 (Temurin) | `C:\atools\jdk-21.0.12+8` |
| Android SDK | `C:\atools\sdk` (platforms 36 **and 37**, build-tools 36.0.0 and 37.0.0) |
| Emulator + API 36 image | installed; AVD named **`carbscan`** |

Launch the emulator headless:

```powershell
C:\atools\sdk\emulator\emulator.exe -avd carbscan -no-window -no-audio -no-boot-anim -no-snapshot -gpu swiftshader_indirect
```

Boot takes ~90 s. Then `C:\atools\sdk\platform-tools\adb.exe devices`.
Note: `connectedAndroidTest` **uninstalls the app afterwards** — reinstall before driving the UI.

### Traps that cost real time

1. **`winget install` hangs forever** — UAC prompt nobody can answer. Portable archives only. No
   admin rights available.
2. **Windows MAX_PATH** breaks SDK extraction into deep scratchpad paths. That's why everything
   lives under the short `C:\atools`. `Expand-Archive` misreports it as a *missing file* error.
3. **`sdkmanager --licenses` ignores piped stdin** — write hash files into `$ANDROID_HOME\licenses`.
4. **AGP 9.x has built-in Kotlin support.** Applying `org.jetbrains.kotlin.android` is a hard error.
   Kotlin options go in `android { kotlin { } }`.
5. **KSP has its own version line** (2.3.11), which does *not* track Kotlin's (2.3.21). Not a bug.
6. **`compileSdk` must be 37, not 36.** AndroidX (core 1.19.0, Compose 1.12.0, lifecycle 2.11.0)
   refuses to compile against 36. `targetSdk` stays **36** — the Play requirement. Independent.
7. **`resValue` needs `buildFeatures { resValues = true }`** in AGP 9.
8. **Don't put the JDK in the session scratchpad.** Temp dirs get cleaned; that is why it now lives
   at `C:\atools\jdk-21.0.12+8`.

## Verified facts (checked 2026-08-13 — do not trust training data over these)

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Play target API requirement | **API 36**, deadline **2026-08-31** |
| AGP / Gradle / JDK | 9.3.1 / 9.7.0 / 21 |
| OFF read rate limit | **15 req/min/IP** — makes cache-first mandatory, not optional |
| OFF User-Agent | Mandatory, must identify the app; documented format `AppName/Version (ContactEmail)` |
| OFF data licence | **ODbL**+DbCL — attribution *and* share-alike |
| OFF image licence (confirmed 2026-08-14) | **CC BY-SA** — separate from the data licence |
| OFF product-read endpoint (confirmed 2026-08-14) | **v3** (`api/v3/product/{barcode}`) — v2 deprecated-but-supported |
| OFF image hosts (confirmed 2026-08-14) | `images.openfoodfacts.org` (live-verified), `static.openfoodfacts.org` (doc-sourced) |

## Owner's confirmed decisions

1. **ml vs g** — portion locked to the product's basis unit. Never assume 1 ml = 1 g.
2. **Rounding** — **decimal dominant** (`31.3 g`), whole gram beneath (`≈ 31 g whole grams`).
   Revised 2026-08-14 (correction #6): the result is transcribed into another calculator, so
   leading with the rounded figure loses precision where it matters. `ResultStyle.WHOLE_DOMINANT`
   restores the old hierarchy if a whole-gram-only destination is ever confirmed.
3. **Regulatory** — build to the **stricter** standard (as if an accessory to a medical device).
4. **Backup** — `allowBackup="false"`.
5. **Provenance ≠ verification** (owner correction, 2026-08-13) — `dataSource`
   (`OPEN_FOOD_FACTS`/`MANUAL`/`OCR`) and `verificationStatus` (`UNVERIFIED`/`USER_VERIFIED`) are
   **separate fields and must stay separate**. A product can come from OFF *and* be verified; that
   provenance must be preserved. Do not "simplify" these back into one enum.
6. Repo stays **private**; docs keep saying CarbQuick until the public name is decided.
7. **No Robolectric** — DAO tests stay instrumented.
8. **Calculation-session immutability** (correction #5) — once the calculator is open, a background
   refresh must NEVER change the value being calculated with. It records the newer figure and shows
   an *Online value changed* notice the user can accept. Regression-tested; do not "simplify".
9. **Regulatory wording** — never describe the app as an accessory to a medical device, or as a
   medical device, or as not one. Qualification is unresolved; the docs say only that the controls
   are conservative while it is.
10. **Countable-portion app language is English-only** (2026-08-14, owner correction mid-session —
    the original brief's Dutch requirement was leftover from an earlier draft). This is about
    *displayed UI strings* only: `ServingSizeParser` still recognizes Dutch remote `serving_size`
    text (the owner is in the Netherlands and OFF data for their products is legitimately Dutch) —
    parsing input in Dutch and displaying the app in English are separate facts, don't conflate
    them if this is revisited.

## Architecture

```
domain/    Pure Kotlin, ZERO Android imports — the safety-critical layer. Keep it that way.
           PortionResolver, ServingSizeParser, PortionUnit(Kind), ProductImageUrlValidator
data/
  local/   Room (v3): ProductEntity/Dao, PortionUnitEntity/Dao, RoomProductDataSource,
           RoomPortionUnitDataSource
  remote/  Retrofit (OFF v3) + OpenFoodFactsDataSource
  settings/DataStore
  ProductRepository   ← owns the §10 lookup priority + portion-unit persistence/verification
ocr/       NutritionLabelParser (pure) + LabelAnalyzer (ML Kit)
ui/        Compose screens + ViewModels, immutable state via StateFlow
```

Key invariants, each pinned by a test:

- `movePointLeft(2)` for ÷100 — exact scale shift, cannot round or throw.
- Whole gram and displayed decimal are derived from `exact` **independently** — never round twice.
- `NutritionBasis` is a label, **never** a conversion factor.
- `isRemoteRefreshable` = not user-authored **AND** unverified. Both conditions matter. Same rule,
  same reasoning, applies per-unit to `PortionUnit.isRemoteRefreshable`.
- Carbohydrate values (and countable-portion weights) are stored as **TEXT** in SQLite, never REAL.
- `ResultFormatter` sets `RoundingMode.HALF_UP` explicitly — `DecimalFormat` defaults to HALF_EVEN,
  which made the app display a different decimal from the one it calculated (15.4 vs 15.5).
- Room schema is at **v3**; `MIGRATION_1_2` adds `latestRemoteCarbs`, `MIGRATION_2_3` adds
  `portion_units` + three `products` columns for remembered countable-portion mode. Never
  destructive. `MIGRATION_2_3`'s `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` calls are guarded by a `PRAGMA
  table_info` check — see "Countable portions" above for why.
- `PortionResolver` is the only place `count × amountPerUnit` happens; it never itself computes a
  carbohydrate value — that stays `CarbCalculator`'s job alone, keeping one formula in the app.

## Working agreements

- Verify library versions against Google Maven / Maven Central. **Stable only.**
- `domain/` stays pure Kotlin — it must be JVM-testable with no emulator.
- **Never claim something builds or passes without having run it.**
- Don't fabricate regulatory or policy wording (§44, §50). If it can't be verified, mark it as an
  owner action with a place to record the source and date.

## Open findings needing the owner

1. **§44 regulatory assessment is unresolved and blocks publication.** See
   `docs/regulatory-release-checklist.md`.
2. **ML Kit telemetry: investigated and settled as far as code can settle it (2026-08-14).**
   `com.google.android.datatransport` comes from `com.google.mlkit:common` and **cannot be
   excluded** — doing so fatally crashes the scanner (`NoClassDefFoundError: CCTDestination`),
   verified on the emulator. No opt-out constant exists in the shipped artifacts; none was
   invented. Disclosed in the privacy policy and Data Safety draft. Owner still owes a review of
   Google's ML Kit disclosures and the Data Safety category choice.
3. **Open Food Facts *image* licensing: now confirmed as CC BY-SA** (2026-08-14, checked against
   `world.openfoodfacts.org/terms-of-use`) — distinct from the database's ODbL/DbCL, as suspected.
   Remaining owner action: the in-app attribution string only covers the database licence; CC
   BY-SA's own attribution line has not been added. See `docs/third-party-notices.md`.
4. Licence for the project not yet chosen.
5. Contact email is still `REPLACE_ME@example.com` throughout — now also a concrete OFF User-Agent
   compliance gap (documented format is `AppName/Version (ContactEmail)`), not just a docs
   placeholder.
6. **Dependency vulnerability scanning has never been run** (identified during the 2026-08-14
   security review) — no OWASP Dependency-Check / CVE-feed pass has ever been done on this
   project's dependency graph. See `docs/security-review.md`.
7. **Countable-portion UI follow-up**: correcting a wrong remote-suggested per-unit weight
   currently means adding a new custom unit, not editing the existing one in place — the
   repository already supports `verifyPortionUnit(unitId, confirmedAmountPerUnit)`, but no UI path
   calls it with a correction yet. See `docs/ux-critique-countable-portions.md`.
